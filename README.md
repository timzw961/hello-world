# hello-world
I am learning how to use GitHub

# My name is Timothy Wang and I am an aspiring Frontend developer that recently started his journey through learning React.
> Right now I'm just trying to familiarise myself with GitHub as many of my projects this semester have GitHub as the primary place to collaborate and share code.
> I am also in my final year of my Bachelor of Computer Science Degree, Majoring in Software Engineering.
